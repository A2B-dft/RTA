# RTA-v1 - An Open-Source Code for Relaxation Time Approximation (RTA)

**RTApy** is an open-source, python based code that computes relaxation time ($\tau$($\vec{k}$)) for each k-point that is generated from the DFT calculations. The primary goal of RTApy is to facilitate the solution of the **Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE)** using the **Relaxation Time Approximation (RTA)** method. 
## Features:
- Computes relaxation time ($\tau$($\vec{k}$)) for the electronic states at each k - point.
- Interfaces with DFT output files.
- Tools for analyzing relaxation times.
- Open-source and python codebase for ease of customization.

## Installation:

Firstly, clone the repository, using the command:

    $ git clone https://github.com/A2B-dft/RTApy.git
